Python Mini Project



Project Title

Contact Book Management System



Project Description

The **Contact Book Management System** is a simple, menu-driven Python console application designed to store and manage contact details efficiently.
It allows users to **add, view, search, and save contact records** using basic Python programming concepts.
This project is beginner-friendly and follows the standard guidelines of a Python mini project.



Objective

* To understand how contact information can be managed using Python
* To practice core Python concepts such as lists, dictionaries, functions, loops, and file handling
* To build a simple, interactive, menu-driven console application



Features

* Add new contact records
* Display all contact details
* Search contacts by name
* Save contact records to a text file
* Menu-driven and user-friendly interface
* Uses pre-defined sample contact data


Concepts Used

* Python Basics
* Lists and Dictionaries
* Functions
* Conditional Statements
* Loops
* Exception Handling (`try` & `except`)
* File Handling (writing data to a `.txt` file)
